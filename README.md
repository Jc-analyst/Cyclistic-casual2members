# R Project (Merging, cleaning, Analysing, Visualization) 

# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Capstone Project

## 📘 About the Project

This analysis was conducted as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**. It explores rider behavior using one year of trip data from Cyclistic — a fictional bike-share company in Chicago — with the goal of recommending strategies to increase **annual memberships**.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Merged 12 months of trip data into a single dataframe  
   - Removed nulls, duplicates, invalid ride lengths  
   - Converted timestamps and engineered new time-related features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Compared casual vs member usage across day of week, ride duration, station start/end  
   - Visualized trends over time and across demographics

3. **Key Visuals (from `/visuals`)**
   - Plot01 – Percentage of Bike Types    
   - Plot02 – Total Rides by Bike Type 
   - Plot03 – Pie Chart of Ride Type Distribution 
   - Plot04 – Total Rides in 2023
   - Plot05 – Monthly Ride Trends in 2023 
   - Plot06 – Total Rides (2023–2024) 

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Members ride more frequently but for shorter durations  
   - Casuals prefer weekends and afternoons  
   - Suggest using trial memberships, targeted weekend discounts, and app-based ride nudges

## 📊 Visualizations

### Plot01 – Percentage of Bike Types  
Bar chart showing the percentage breakdown of bike types used (e.g., classic, docked, electric). This highlights rider preferences by bike category.  
📁 `visuals/bike_type_percentage.png`

### Plot02 – Total Rides by Bike Type  
Displays the total number of rides taken with each bike type. Helps identify demand and usage levels across categories.  
📁 `visuals/total_rides_by_type.png`

### Plot03 – Pie Chart of Ride Type Distribution  
A pie chart visualizing the ratio between **member** and **casual** riders across all trips. Shows how the user base is split.  
📁 `visuals/ride_type_distribution_pie.png`

### Plot04 – Total Rides in 2023  
Bar or line chart of all rides logged during the 2023 calendar year. Useful for identifying peak ridership months or seasons.  
📁 `visuals/total_rides_2023.png`

### Plot05 – Monthly Ride Trends in 2023  
Line graph showing how ride counts fluctuated each month in 2023. Clear insight into seasonal and behavioral changes.  
📁 `visuals/monthly_ride_trends_2023.png`

### Plot06 – Total Rides (2023–2024)  
Combined visualization showing total ride volumes across two full years (2023 and 2024), helping assess overall growth or decline.  
📁 `visuals/total_rides_2023_2024.png`
